# CONUS Real Estate EDA with R

This repository contains a course project for a Statistical Computing class, where I used R to explore and analyze real estate data across the Continental United States (CONUS).

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a real estate dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and insights across different U.S. regions. The project was completed using R and focuses on visualizing and interpreting key variables affecting property value, distribution, and regional disparities.
